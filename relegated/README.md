# Deprecated Examples

These examples use the older MCP SDK API and are kept for reference only.

**⚠️ These examples are deprecated and should not be used for new projects.**

## Why deprecated?

These examples use the legacy `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with `McpServer` and `TabServerTransport`. The new WebMCP API is much simpler and requires less boilerplate.

## New API

For current examples using the modern API, see:
- `/vanilla` - Modern vanilla JavaScript example
- `/react` - Modern React example

## What's in here?

- `vanilla-ts` - Original TypeScript example with MCP SDK
- `login` - Authentication example with old API
- `script-tag` - Legacy script tag implementation
- `mcp-b-startup` - Complex React Flow workspace
- `extension-connector` - Chrome extension connector
- `reactFlowVoiceAgent` - Voice-enabled agent with old API

These are preserved for reference but should not be used as starting points for new projects.
