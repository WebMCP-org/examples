# MCP-B Personal AI Website Demo

## The Revolutionary Concept

This demo showcases **MCP-B (Model Context Protocol for Browsers)** - a new way for AI assistants to interact with websites. Instead of clicking buttons like a human, AI builds and uses **real APIs** that websites provide.

## What Makes This Special?

### Traditional Browser Automation
```
AI: "Take a screenshot"
AI: "Where's the 'Add to Cart' button?"  
AI: "Click at coordinates (245, 387)"
AI: "Take another screenshot"
AI: "Did that work?"
```
*Fragile, slow, expensive*

### MCP-B Approach  
```
AI: "Call addToCart({productId: 'abc123', quantity: 2})"
Website: "Added 2x Widget to cart. Total: $19.99"
```
*Robust, fast, precise*

## Live Demo Features

This demo shows an AI assistant managing a personal website with:

- **Real-time mood updates** that change the page theme
- **Dynamic todo list management** with live UI updates  
- **Thought recording** that immediately appears on screen
- **Interactive counter** with AI-callable increment functions
- **Visual notifications** when AI tools are used
- **Animated status cards** that update as AI works

## The Development Loop

1. **Write MCP tools** in your website code
2. **Tools automatically appear** in AI's toolkit  
3. **AI calls tools** and sees immediate results
4. **Add more tools** as needed
5. **Each tool builds on previous ones**

## Quick Start

### For AI Assistants
See [README-FOR-AI.md](./README-FOR-AI.md) - Complete guide to building and using your own tools

### For Developers  
See [README-FOR-DEVELOPERS.md](./README-FOR-DEVELOPERS.md) - How to integrate MCP-B into your website

### Try the Demo

1. **Install** the MCP-B browser extension
2. **Run** this demo: `pnpm dev` 
3. **Visit** http://localhost:5173
4. **Open** the extension and see tools appear
5. **Call tools** and watch the page update in real-time!

## Key Innovations

### 🔧 Self-Building Tools
AI doesn't just use tools - it **creates the tools it needs** while working on your website.

### 👁️ Transparent Operations
Every AI action shows up immediately in the UI. No mysterious background operations.

### 🚀 Instant Iteration
Write code → See tools → Use tools → Add more tools. The development cycle happens in real-time.

### 🎯 Intent-Based APIs
Instead of "click button", AI calls "submitForm" or "addToCart" - expressing **what** it wants, not **how** to do it.

### 🔄 Collaborative Interface
The same UI serves both human users and AI assistants. Both can see what the other is doing.

## Example Tool Flow

```typescript
// 1. AI writes this tool
server.tool("updateMood", "Change my current mood", {
  mood: z.string()
}, async ({ mood }) => {
  state.mood = mood;
  updateUI();
  showNotification(`Mood updated to: ${mood}`);
  return { content: [{ type: "text", text: `Mood is now: ${mood}` }] };
});

// 2. Tool appears in AI's available tools automatically

// 3. AI calls the tool
// Call: updateMood({mood: "excited about MCP-B"})
// Result: Page theme changes, notification appears, status updates

// 4. AI can immediately see the result and build on it
```

## Why This Matters

### For AI Development
- **No more prompt engineering** for screen coordinates
- **Reliable automation** that doesn't break when UI changes
- **Rich context** access to full application state
- **Immediate feedback** loop for development

### For Web Development  
- **Same codebase** serves humans and AI
- **Existing authentication** and security models work
- **Progressive enhancement** - add AI capabilities without changing core app
- **Standard web technologies** - no special AI frameworks needed

### For Users
- **Transparent AI actions** - see exactly what AI is doing
- **Collaborative workflows** - human and AI working together
- **Immediate results** - no waiting for screen scraping
- **Natural interactions** - AI understands your website's intent

## Real-World Applications

- **E-commerce**: AI that can actually add to cart, apply discounts, checkout
- **CRM**: AI that updates leads, schedules meetings, generates reports  
- **Content Management**: AI that publishes posts, moderates comments, manages media
- **Analytics**: AI that queries data, generates insights, creates dashboards
- **Social Media**: AI that posts updates, responds to messages, manages campaigns

## Get Started Today

This isn't just a demo - it's a **new development paradigm**. Start building websites that AI can actually use properly:

1. **Clone this repo** and run the demo
2. **Read the guides** for your role (AI or Developer)  
3. **Experiment** with adding your own tools
4. **Build** the AI-native web
